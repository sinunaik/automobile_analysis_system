# Car Type Analysis

This project involves creating a structured SQL database for car models and performing data analysis to extract insights about car specifications, performance, and pricing. The dataset encompasses various attributes of cars, enabling users to analyze trends in car pricing, fuel efficiency, horsepower, engine size, and more.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Store detailed car information in a structured database.
- Analyze car pricing to identify trends and outliers.
- Determine cars with the best fuel efficiency.
- Identify high-performance cars based on horsepower.
- Explore cars with the largest engine sizes by fuel type.

These insights are valuable for car buyers, automotive analysts, and enthusiasts who seek to make informed decisions based on car specifications and pricing.

## Database Structure

The database is structured around a single table, `car_type`, which holds detailed information about each car model. The attributes cover various aspects of car design, performance, and cost.

### Table: `car_type`

The `car_type` table includes the following columns:

| Column             | Data Type        | Description                                      |
|--------------------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `model`            | `VARCHAR(50)`    | The car model name (e.g., "BMW 3 Series").        |
| `fuel_type`        | `VARCHAR(20)`    | Type of fuel used (e.g., "gas", "diesel").         |
| `aspiration`       | `VARCHAR(20)`    | Aspiration type (e.g., "turbo", "naturally aspirated"). |
| `num_of_doors`     | `VARCHAR(10)`    | Number of doors (e.g., "2", "4").                 |
| `body_style`       | `VARCHAR(30)`    | Car body style (e.g., "sedan", "hatchback").      |
| `drive_wheels`     | `VARCHAR(10)`    | Drive type (e.g., "fwd" for front-wheel drive).  |
| `engine_location`  | `VARCHAR(10)`    | Engine location (e.g., "front", "rear").         |
| `wheel_base`       | `FLOAT`          | Distance between front and rear wheels (in inches). |
| `length`, `width`, `height` | `FLOAT`   | Car dimensions (length, width, height in inches). |
| `curb_weight`      | `INT`            | Weight of the car without passengers or cargo (in lbs). |
| `engine_type`      | `VARCHAR(20)`    | Type of engine (e.g., "dohc", "ohcv").           |
| `num_of_cylinders`  | `VARCHAR(20)`    | Number of cylinders (e.g., "4", "6").           |
| `engine_size`      | `INT`            | Engine displacement (in cc).                     |
| `fuel_system`      | `VARCHAR(20)`    | Fuel injection system (e.g., "mpfi", "spdi").   |
| `bore`, `stroke`   | `FLOAT`          | Cylinder bore and stroke dimensions (in inches). |
| `compression_ratio`| `FLOAT`          | Compression ratio of the engine.                 |
| `horsepower`, `peak_rpm` | `INT`        | Engine power output and peak RPM.                |
| `city_mpg`, `highway_mpg` | `INT`       | Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) in city and highway conditions. |
| `price`            | `INT`            | Manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) in USD. |

## Data Analysis

The following SQL queries are used to perform key analyses:

### 1. Record Count
Calculates the total number of cars in the dataset.
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM car_type;
```
**Purpose:** Understand the dataset size.

### 2. Identify Missing Prices
Finds cars where the price is not available.
```sql
SELECT * FROM car_type WHERE price IS NULL;
```
**Purpose:** Address missing data, which could affect pricing analysis.

### 3. Average Car Price
Calculates the average price across all cars with available price data.
```sql
SELECT AVG(price) FROM car_type;
```
**Purpose:** Gauge the typical price range of cars in the dataset.

### 4. Top 5 Most Expensive Cars
Lists the five most expensive cars by price.
```sql
SELECT model, fuel_type, price FROM car_type WHERE price IS NOT NULL ORDER BY price DESC LIMIT 5;
```
**Purpose:** Identify high-end car models.

### 5. Best Fuel Efficiency Cars
Finds cars with the best city and highway mileage.
```sql
SELECT model, city_mpg, highway_mpg FROM car_type ORDER BY city_mpg DESC, highway_mpg DESC LIMIT 10;
```
**Purpose:** Help users choose cars with the best fuel economy.

### 6. High Horsepower Cars
Selects cars with horsepower greater than 200.
```sql
SELECT model, horsepower FROM car_type WHERE horsepower > 200 ORDER BY horsepower DESC;
```
**Purpose:** Highlight performance-oriented cars.

### 7. Largest Engine Size by Fuel Type
Identifies cars with the largest engine size for each fuel type.
```sql
SELECT fuel_type, model, engine_size FROM car_type AS c1
WHERE engine_size = (SELECT MAX(engine_size) FROM car_type AS c2 WHERE c1.fuel_type = c2.fuel_type)
ORDER BY fuel_type;
```
**Purpose:** Compare engine sizes across different fuel types.

## Insights and Applications

The analysis from this dataset allows users to:

- **Make informed purchasing decisions** by comparing prices and fuel efficiency.
- **Explore high-performance car options** by evaluating horsepower data.
- **Understand engine technology trends** by examining engine size and type across fuel categories.
- **Identify pricing outliers** and adjust budget expectations when considering car purchases.

This project provides valuable insights for car buyers, automotive analysts, and manufacturers interested in understanding market trends and consumer preferences.

## Future Enhancements

- **Expand Dataset:** Include more car models and manufacturers for a comprehensive analysis.
- **Add More Attributes:** Incorporate safety ratings, emission standards, and advanced technological features.
- **Visualizations:** Integrate data visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) for more interactive insights.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Use machine learning models to predict car prices and fuel efficiency based on car features.

## Conclusion

The `car_type` database and accompanying analysis serve as a robust tool for exploring car specifications, pricing, and performance metrics. It aids in data-driven decision-making for car buyers and provides insights into industry trends.
